1. Choose a routing service feature. Describe it in detail. Give examples when it is useful and when it is not.

	CHOSEN FEATURE: Multipoint routing

		- This feature was introduced to Google Maps in 2016, is quite usefull since with it it became possible to create routes, not only from one point to another
		  but including different locations through the route, and of course the route gets modified to find the best way of getting from the start to the end
		  but passing through these point in the most efficient way it is possible.
	
		- USEFUL: If for example I want to go from my house to the city centre but passing through the store, then I just have to add the new point to the route,
			  but also in more complicated examples, like for example if you are having a long trip by car, and you know for sure that It will be necessary to 
			  refill the fuel tank, then adding one point in a fuel station during the route would solve the problem.

		- NOT USEFUL: Since using it is really optional, then I think that is always useful, if you don't want to pass through intermediate points then It's not even	
			      necessary to use the feature, then just use the two points route.

2. Find two services that provide an API. Explain what they offer. Do they allow GET or POST requests? Is it JSON or some other format?

	SERVICE 1: Skyscanner Flight Search

		- "The Skyscanner API lets you search for flights & get flight prices from Skyscanner's database of prices, as well as get live quotes directly from ticketing agencies." ~ extracted from RapidAPI
		- Mostly GET requests (GET Browse Quotes, GET Browse Routes) but also one POST request for creating a session (POST Create Session)
		- The format of the response as it's seen in the example It's JSON (https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search)

	SERVICE 2: Pokemon Go API

		- "API that is dedicated to various machine readable data about Pokemon Go.." ~ extracted from RapidAPI
		- Since is only dedicated to retrieve information about the game, only GET requests
		- Again the format of the response as it's seen in the example It's JSON (https://rapidapi.com/brianiswu/api/pokemon-go1)



3. Give four pros and four cons for using a server-side API.

	PROS:
	
		- It's usefull to have client and server divided and just communicating through some technology like JSON, with this separation It's possible
		  for example to have two different teams working on both sides, and if It's necessary to make any change in any side, it can be done without 
		  affecting the other side.

		- With the same API Rest is possible to develop multiple client-side adaptations, for example you can start developing an application for iOS
		  or Android and with the exact same API Rest then do a website.

		- Since with API Rest you only receive from the server plain data and not the full HTML+CSS pages, it takes less resources from the server.

		- It has a lot of realiability since the only thing you need is a strong communication between the Client and the server, if that is correct
		  then you can change your database, the techology you use or anything and there won't be any problem.

	CONS:
	
		- It's hard to adapt to this technology if you have already on your mind the idea of classic server, for example in this APIs it exists the possibility
		  that there are multiple servers attending the requests, then between servers they don't know if an user has logged using another server or not.

		- At the beggining it will take a longer time to develop the structure of the API, but It's true that that time can be regained when the whole API is 
		  already developed.

		- It requires to have more knowledge about how HTTP and HTTPS protocols work.

		- If your server side is based on REST it can happen to experience a desynchronization if the server-side is working/devolping things with a slower rythm


4. Detective exercise

	- Record the time it took to find it: 4'40''
	a) What is the transportation mode?: As we can see in the pictures is bike
	b) Are there similar routes in the database?: There are more routes through Kuopio
	c) Was Radu traveling alone?: Also on the pictures we can see that He is at least with another guy
	d) How round is the route?: It's 72 Km around Kuopio
	e) How many stops are there?: There are picture taken in 3 to 5 places so at least 3 (Since is the only route that passes through that places)
	f) How many hills are there?:
