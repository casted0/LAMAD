1.Use the Mopsi recommendation system somewhere in your city. Write down the top five results. Why do you think these items are in the list?
  Is the result useful? Is anything surprising in the list?

  I've used the recommendation system in Madrid, the results have been in this order:

    - Palace Hotel
    - Puerta de Toledo
    - San Francisco el Grande Basilica
    - San Andres Church
    - Mercado de San Miguel

  This items are interest points or useful places (Palace hotel), I think is general is useful but is really wide, like Palace hotel is 
  maybe economically not up for everybody, but I don't think that's a problem of Mopsi cause I didn't specify any filter of price or related.
  So the results are not surprising since 4 of 5 items are really touristic places and they are really close to the Mopsi marker I placed.
 
2.Give two examples, decisions that make an interface good and decisions that make an interface bad.

    - Good:
        · In order to make an interface clearer, It's a good idea to substitute text buttons for icons or images
        · At least for me It's really comfortable when a website has hovers, it's really nice and make you feel the interaction

    - Bad:
        · An interface should be as much simple as possible, therefor an excess of text or buttons in the same screen is a bad idea
        · There should be an harmony between all the aspects in the screen, different sizes in the components is in general a bad idea  
          if there's not a good reason for it to be.

3.In  software  development, compatibility  is  important.  Explain  in  your  own  words  what  the following concepts mean:

    1.device compatibility: Device compatibility is the aspect of some software that makes it usable in multiple type of devices such as
                            for example, webpages or applications that are useful in computers and smartphones or tablets
    2.backwards compatibility: Compatibility in a software or hardware system with older or different versions of itself. For example           
                               the first version of PS3 was able to read and play PS2 games.

Can you give hypothetical examples for each?

4.Test the Wind Router. Give any comments to Radu’s slide:
    https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BE_kIfkWlmy97J35CZIz2mhb1cnmG6yEAhKwf2h3IZw/edit?usp=sharingFeedback can be anything:
    report bugs, suggest improvements, what features would be cool?
    
5.Who is the target audience for the Wind Router?

    Everyone that wants to be aware of wind direction and how it affects the routes, for example in a cold place you may be 
    trying to avoid strong wind, but in a warm city in summer, thinking about using the wind might do the route more comfortable.
